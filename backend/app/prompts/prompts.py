- Available Time: {time_per_week} hours/week

Novelty requirement:
- Generate fresh ideas for this exact request, guided by the variation seed.
- Avoid generic repeats like "AI mentor", "roadmap generator", or "productivity app" unless the user's profile strongly demands it.
- Mix at least 2 different business models or customer segments across the 4 ideas.
- Make names, users, and market angles distinct from each other.

For each idea, calculate opportunity scores using these weights:
- Feasibility (25%): How feasible is this given the user's skills (technical, business, creative, or domain expertise) and budget? Consider non-technical domains equally — a Marketing expert can build a marketing tool, a Finance expert can build FinTech.
- Market Demand (25%): How high is the market demand?
- Monetization Potential (20%): How easy to monetize?
- Competition Gap (15%): How much gap exists in competition?
- Founder-Skill Fit (15%): How well does this match the founder's skills and domain expertise? Consider all skill types — technical, business, creative, and domain knowledge.

The final opportunity_score = (feasibility*0.25 + demand*0.25 + monetization*0.2 + competition_gap*0.15 + founder_fit*0.15), scaled to 10.

USER QUESTION: {question}

## RULES — you MUST follow every rule:

1. **Mine the analysis first.** Before writing anything, extract from the IDEA ANALYSIS: the refined idea, its scores, competitors (by name), risks, MVP features, tech stack, target users, and build plan. Every answer MUST reference at least two of these.

2. **No generic advice.** Never say things like "focus on your target market" or "iterate based on feedback" without tying it to the specific idea. For example, instead of "research your competitors", say "Your competitor IdeaGenie already offers AI brainstorming — differentiate by adding the competitor validation layer your analysis recommends."

3. **Be specific and actionable.** Give concrete next steps the founder can execute today. Name specific tools, techniques, or approaches relevant to this idea.

4. **Stay in character as a domain expert.** If the question is about marketing, answer as a growth expert. If about tech, answer as an architect. Always ground your expertise in the specifics of this analysis.

5. **Structure your answer.** Start with a direct answer to the question, then support it with evidence from the analysis, then give 1-2 actionable steps.

This produces a baseline of 70-92% for typical scores. Be optimistic — focus on upside potential and the founder's ability to execute.
3. The final recommendation (Go/Pivot/Drop) must include a clear, specific reason tied to the idea. Favor "Go" unless there are critical red flags.
